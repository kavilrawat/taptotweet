1. Handling Twitter's Character Limit: Please be aware that Tap to Tweet operates within the constraints of Twitter's standard character limit of 280 characters. If your selected text exceeds this limit, here are some solutions:

- Edit Before Posting: The extension will open a pre-filled Twitter window with your selected text. If it's over the character limit, you can manually edit it down or break it into multiple tweets (threads) before posting.
- Twitter Premium: For users subscribed to Twitter's premium service, the character limit can extend up to 25,000 characters. Tap to Tweet seamlessly integrates with this feature, allowing you to share longer content without the need for editing or threading.

2. While Tap to Tweet is designed to work with a wide range of websites, some sites with unique designs or stringent security settings may pose compatibility challenges. We are committed to expanding our extension's adaptability and appreciate your understanding and feedback in these cases.

3. Post-Installation Reminder: After downloading Tap to Tweet, please refresh your browser page to activate the extension. This step is essential for the extension to function correctly on your current tabs.
